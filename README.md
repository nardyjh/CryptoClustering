# CryptoClustering

CryptoClustering is a project that involves clustering cryptocurrencies based on market data using K-Means clustering. The project aims to explore the impact of using fewer features for clustering through techniques such as K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Introduction

The CryptoClustering project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Load cryptocurrency market data, scale numerical features, and explore data statistics.

2. **Original Data Clustering:** Use K-Means clustering on the original data to identify the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Optimization with PCA:** Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features and find the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Visual Analysis:** Visualize and compare the clustering results using both original data and PCA-optimized data.

## Setup

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Load the cryptocurrency market data:

```bash 
import pandas as pd

df_market_data = pd.read_csv("Resources/crypto_market_data.csv", index_col="coin_id")
```

Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook for the CryptoClustering project.
Explore the clustering results, visualizations, and analysis.

## Results

The project includes visualizations of the Elbow curves for both original data and PCA-optimized data, along with scatter plots showcasing the clustering results.

### Original Data Clustering
- The optimal number of clusters (k) is determined using the Elbow curve.
- Cryptocurrencies are clustered based on their price change percentages.

### Optimization with PCA
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- The total explained variance of the three principal components is calculated.
- Clustering is performed using PCA-optimized data.

### Visual Analysis
- Composite plots are provided to contrast the Elbow curves and cluster results using both original data and PCA-optimized data.
